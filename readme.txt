== Description ==

Sort author options in alphabetical order of login name.

It's useful for administrators and editors of websites which have more than a hundred users and use Chinese characters or other character-rich language to assign or switch their author quickly.

== Screenshots ==

1. Without plugin. It's impossible to remember unicode order for chinese character. User should search by their eyes one by one.
2. With plugin. It's easier to find user name. Also, you can type alphabet and navigate to the item.
